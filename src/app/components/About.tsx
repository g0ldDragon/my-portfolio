        Hi there! 
        <br />
        I'm Joshua Wilson, a driven Frontend Developer specializing in
        ReactJS, React Native, NextJS, and JavaScript. With a keen eye for
        detail and a passion for clean code, I'm always looking to enhance my
        skillset and evolve into the role of a Fullstack Developer.
        <br /><br />
        Transparency, efficiency, relationships, trust, and accountability are
        the cornerstones of my work ethic. When I'm not immersed in coding,
        you'll find me on the squash court, always up for a challenging match. I
        have a silent passion for health, fitness, and nutrition, constantly
        seeking self-improvement. Embracing the philosophy of growing by 1%
        every day fuels my personal development journey. 
        <br /><br />
        My educational background includes a 3-year course at CTU Training Solutions in
        Boksburg, where I obtained an NQF level 6 in IT Database Development in
        2022. Additionally, I hold several certifications, including a National
        Certificate in IT Systems Development, FET Certificate in Systems
        Development, and relevant online certificates such as Next.js & React -
        The Complete Guide and Understanding TypeScript. 
        <br /><br />
        Though my work experience in the industry is limited, I embarked on a 6-month
        internship as a fullstack developer intern at Northroom Technologies,
        gaining valuable insights and honing my frontend development skills.
        Now, I'm eager to broaden my skillset and embrace the challenges of
        backend development to become a well-rounded Fullstack Developer. 
        <br /><br />
        My technical skills encompass a range of technologies, including ReactJS,
        React Native, NextJS, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Microsoft SQL Server,
        T-SQL, and more. Alongside my technical expertise, I bring a
        problem-solving mindset, meticulous attention to detail, and a highly
        motivated work ethic. 
        <br /><br />
        Throughout my journey, I've contributed to various projects, tackling tasks 
        such as bug fixing, resolving UI issues, and building components. I've also 
        started projects from scratch, designing navigational structures, crafting 
        components, and implementing functionality. You can explore some of these 
        projects in my GitHub repository. 
        <br /><br />
        What drives me is the belief that technology, 
        when harnessed effectively, can have a profound positive impact on the world. I'm
        committed to providing sophisticated, high-functioning, and visually
        pleasing web and mobile solutions that empower businesses and
        individuals to thrive. Continuous learning is at the core of my
        motivation, and I firmly believe in the transformative power of personal
        growth. 
        <br /><br />
        Beyond the world of web development, I'm passionate about
        health, wellbeing, fitness, and overall happiness. Whether I'm on the
        squash court, hitting the gym, or diving into self-help literature, I'm
        constantly seeking ways to improve and understand myself on a deeper
        level. Music is a source of inspiration, as I explore diverse genres to
        broaden my emotional perspective. Eastern practices like Qigong and
        meditation fascinate me, fueling my desire to delve into the holistic
        side of health. 
        <br /><br />
